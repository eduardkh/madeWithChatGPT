The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that is used to ensure that a class has only one instance, and to provide a global point of access to that instance.

The pattern is useful in situations where it is important to have only one instance of a class, such as when working with a shared resource, such as a database connection, or when working with a configuration object that needs to be loaded only once. By ensuring that there is only one instance of the class, you can avoid potential issues such as resource contention or inconsistencies in the data.

The pattern typically involves creating a private constructor for the class, so that it cannot be instantiated from outside the class, and a static method that returns the sole instance of the class. The static method typically checks whether an instance of the class already exists, and creates one if it does not.
