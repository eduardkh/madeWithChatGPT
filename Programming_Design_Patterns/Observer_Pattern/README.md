# Observer Pattern

> Observer Pattern explained

This pattern involves creating a subject object that maintains a list of its dependents (observers) and notifies them automatically of any state changes. This can be useful for implementing event-driven architectures, such as triggering notifications when new data is added to a database.

Imagine you have a toy that makes a sound every time you press a button. You also have two friends who like to play with the toy. One of them is always watching the toy, waiting for someone to press the button. The other friend is always doing something else, but wants to know when someone presses the button so they can come and join the fun.

In programming terms, we can think of the toy as the "subject" object, and the two friends as the "observers". The subject maintains a list of its observers (in this case, the two friends), and notifies them automatically whenever something happens (in this case, whenever the button is pressed).

So, when you or your first friend press the button, the subject (the toy) automatically notifies the other friend that the button has been pressed, without the friend having to constantly watch the toy.

In software development, the Observer Pattern is a way of creating a relationship between objects where one object (the subject) automatically notifies other objects (the observers) when a change occurs. This can be useful for implementing event-driven architectures, such as triggering notifications when new data is added to a database, or updating the user interface when the data changes.
